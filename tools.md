# Awesome Volunteer Computing [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

**volunteer computing** — the practice of donating idle computing power to help solve real-world scientific and humanitarian problems.

Early pioneers like **[GIMPS](https://www.mersenne.org/)**  and **[distributed.net](https://www.distributed.net/)** paved the way for modern platforms that aggregate these resources into powerful virtual supercomputers, enabling research otherwise impossible.
