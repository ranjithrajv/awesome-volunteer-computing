# About This Project
In today’s era of rapid AI and LLM (Large Language Model) development, we see groundbreaking models released almost daily. However, one critical issue is often overlooked: the massive computational resources required to train these models.


## The Problem
Training foundational models like GPT, LLaMA, or DeepSeek requires access to enormous GPU clusters—something only a handful of tech giants and well-funded startups can afford. The capital expenditure (CAPEX) involved is extremely high, creating a significant barrier to entry. This results in:
 * A monopoly on foundational model development
 * Limited accessibility for researchers, hobbyists, and small organizations
 * A lack of transparency around model training data and practices

## What Can Be Done?
While renting cloud GPU clusters is one path, it's financially impractical for most. An alternative solution is volunteer computing—a model where people contribute their idle computing power for a shared, community-driven cause.

Volunteer computing is not new. Projects like Folding@Home have proven that distributed efforts can achieve massive scale.
By applying this approach to AI, we can build a community-powered foundational model—one that is:
 * Free
 * Open
 * Ethical
 * Privacy-conscious


## The Vision
* A truly open-source model built by the community, for the community
* Transparent training datasets—chosen and vetted collectively
* Models that can be fine-tuned and deployed without fear of hidden limitations or licensing issues
* Respect for privacy and ethical data use baked into the training process
